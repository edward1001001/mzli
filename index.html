       <h1>Welcome to Mengzhou Li's 1-page intro!</h1>
       <p>Mengzhou Li is a PhD student enjoys solving real-world problems from both hardware and software sides. His work on <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-0233/27/12/125014/meta">‘Limited Energy Loss reading criterion’</a> was adopted in ISO standard for highest reading accuracy in optical measurement of grooves. His recent research interest covers the whole chain of PCCT (Photon-Counting CT) from the correction for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03119">data imperfection</a>, system misalignment, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2646714">patient motion</a> to the deep reconstruction. He is the recipient of Science and Technology Progress Award 2017 by Chinese Society for Measurement and Standards Innovation Contribution Award 2022 by State Administration for Market Regulation of China.</a></p>
